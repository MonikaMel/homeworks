# Complexity

# Since our tree height is O(lg(n)),
# we could do up to O(lg(n)) moves.
# Across all n nodes, that's an overall time complexity of O(nlg(n)).
# After transforming the tree into a heap,
# we remove all n elements from itâ€”one item at a time.
# Removing from a heap takes O(lg(n)) time,
# since we have to move a new value to the root of the heap and bubble down.
# Doing n remove operations will be O(nlg(n)) time.
